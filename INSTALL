Installation
============

Basic installation
------------------

.Go compiler

WebRocket is written in Go language. If you don't have Go compiler
installed yet, follow this installation guide: http://golang.org/doc/install.html

IMPORTANT: So far, WebRocket is using bunch of unreleased features
and want to catch up with the Go's development, that's why you
should remember to clone *the head version* or the latest *weakly release*:

To get head version of the compiler use following command:

	$ hg clone https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ go

.Dependencies

Now you have to install all external dependencies. Here's the list
of requried deps:

'asciidoc'::
	documentation and man pages generator
		

TIP: If you're happy user of shitty OSX, in case to make the 'asciidoc'
work properly you have to register the installed docbook.

	$ brew install docbook asciidoc
	$ sudo docbook-register

On any other normal Linux/Unix distribution it's enough to just install deps
with your favorite package manager:

	$ sudo apt-get install docbook asciidoc

.WebRocket

Once you have the Go compiler and all dependencies installed, we can move
to building our WebRocket installation. Building WebRocket is very easy and
shouldn't cause too much problems. After you will clone the repository, just
use standard `make` targets to build and install:

	$ git clone git://github.com/nu7hatch/webrocket.git
	$ cd webrocket
	$ git submodule init && git submodule update
	$ make
	$ make check # it's a good idea to run tests

Usage
-----
Now all WebRocket tools should be available in your system. Check
the manual entries for each of them to get information about how do
they work. List of available manual entries:

* *webrocket*(7)
